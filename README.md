Mini Project done in my Under Graduation:

Industry  is a group of productive enterprises or organizations that produce or supply goods, services, or sources of income.Primary industry -agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, quarrying, and the extraction of minerals.Secondary industry-deals with the manufacturing, Involve the manufacture of raw materials.Tertiary Industry-deals with Services industry, Neither produce a raw material nor make a product.Quaternary Industries-Involve the use of high tech industries. People who work for these companies are often highly qualified within their field of work.The IoT is a network of intelligent computers, devices, and objects that collect and share huge amounts of data.The further generation industries will be definitely more advanced and automatic as compared with existing ones. This brings on a new terminology of “Smart Industries”.

We propose an Smart monitoring system using sensors.This monitors the internal parameters of the industry.The internal parameters that we considered are Temperature, Smoke, Fire, Light and Motion Detection.In addition to this , it sends notifications to smartphone and e-mail when any of the parameter crosses the threshold level.The industry officials can have a constant monitoring of the system if any of the parameter changes.The sensors are connected to Node MCU which is powered using power supply source and connected to the server using common WIFI .The  IOT platform which we are using is “BLYNK” , which is an open source application available on Android Play Store and AppStore.

Attached are the CODE and reports for my project.
